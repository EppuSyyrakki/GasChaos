#Grandma tutorial
callGrandmother=Hello dearie, how nice of you to call! Everything good at the farm? What did you want to talk about?
G1=So you bought a farm, and need help gettin debt-free, deary? Well you\u2019ve got your work cut out for you, but I\u2019m sure \
  you\u2019ll manage. I\u2019ve got plenty of advice for you, but here\u2019s just the basics: \
  Feed your cows often and stock up on grain for feed. They eat like locusts, boy howdy.\
  The cowshed has to be cleaned regularly from all that manure. The silver lining here \
  is you can use it to make your own biogas and quality fertilizer. We didn\u2019t have that back \
  in my day. Be sure to take care of your fields, so you don\u2019t have to buy much grain to feed your cows.
G2=Sowing, fertilizing and reaping are gonna be your A, B and C. I\u2019ve heard you can use those \
  computing doohickeys to buy equipment, so be sure to keep that in mind. You move around by \
  tapping the screen, and clicking on buildings will transition you inside of them. There are many \
  different areas on your farm - visit them and I\u2019ll tell you more about each! But listen to me \
  rambling on! 
tutorialFarm=The farm view is a hub that allows entry to all the other places on \
  your estate: You can use the tractor to go to your fields, visit your cows in the barn, go tend to \
  your garden, check your resource levels at the gas tank, or enter your home to order resources \
  and upgrades from the Internet. I will tell you more about them as you go. 
tutorialFarm2=At first I recommend \
  you go home and order another cow and maybe a new milking machine to get your milk production \
  going. You\u2019ve got your hands full, but don\u2019t forget to call your dear old grandma!
tutorialBarn=The barn is your cows\u2019 home. It can house six of them. One cow needs 30kgs of grain every \
  day. One feeding will keep them going for 2 days. If they have food, they will produce milk, manure \
  and methane. Selling milk happens automatically every day, but you have to clean out the manure every couple of \
  days. Methane gets stored in the cows backpacks, and they fill up in about 3 days. After that they must be \
  emptied manually into the main tank.
tutorialBuySell=Here you can buy and sell resources. Money from sales will arrive on \
  the next day, as will any bought resources. Selling gas is the surest way to make money since it \
  is not needed to run the farm. Selling manure is also quite useful, since only a part of it can \
  be composted to produce fertilizers and gas. 
tutorialBuySell2=Right now you don\u2019t have too much of either, so I\u2019d hold on to those for now. For a start, \
  I recommend you buy another cow.
tutorialComputer=This is your computer, connected to the Internet. You can go on to buy and sell, upgrade your \
  farm, or check your bank account. Some tips about money: You get a small amount daily from selling milk, \
  but bigger amounts are tied to selling other resources. It\u2019s worthwhile to wait until you have plenty of one \
  resource before selling to get a big pile of money from a single sale. It\u2019s also useful to keep some money \
  as a buffer - the bank wants their debt payments with interest every 5 days.
tutorialField=The fields are for growing grain of course. You own the top 2 ones, and the others can be \
  rented if you want to expand. At first the grain must be sown of course. Each field has Nitrogen (N) \
  and Phosphorous (P) levels. The higher these are, the better the crops will grow. But be careful - \
  too much fertilizer may cause the environmental inspector to issue you a fine for ruinging the nearby \
  waterway.
tutorialField2=For now you might want to sow one of your own fields up top! You have enough resources to fertilize it tomorrow.
tutorialGarden=The garden is pride of your yard! Here grow fresh herbs, potatoes, carrots and the like. \
  The vegetables grow without help, but the weeds that spread everywhere will slow down their growth. \
  You can check the amount of weeds by touching the shovel, and harvest and sell by clicking the garden itself. \
  You can plant the vegetables by touching the seed bag.
tutorialGasTank=The methane collected from the cows\u2019 backpacks is stored here. There are also additional \
  sensors that give you the exact resource amounts and their limits. The fertilizers are produced automatically \
  from manure in the course of a few turns. You can check all resources by touching the blue diamond.
tutorialHome=This is your humble home. You can end your turn by touching the bed, buy and sell stuff and check \
  your money status on the computer, and call me anytime on the phone.
tutorialHome2=For now, maybe you could get on the computer so we can expand your farm a bit?
tutorialUpgrade=These are the available upgrades for your farm: Solar panels to reduce the electricity bill, \
  more efficient methane collectors for your cows, a gas generator, 2 types of tractor and a better milking \
  machine. These are not needed to run your farm, but they do make it more cost-effective.
tutorialUpgrade2= For your first upgrade you should consider buying a better milking machine to \
  improve your daily income.
