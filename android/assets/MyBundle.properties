#Grandma tutorial
G1=So you bought a farm, deary? G1=Well you\u2019ve got your work cut out for you, but I'm sure you'll manage. \
  I've got plenty of advice for you, but heres just the basics to get you started:

G2=Feed your cows daily and be sure to stock up on feed. They eat like locusts, boy howdy. \
  The cowshed has to be cleaned regularly from that nasty brown stuff that I don't deem suitable to say outloud. \
  The silver lining here is you can use it to make your own biogas, we didin\u2019t have that back in my day. \
  Now be sure to take care of your fields, so you can make some moolah from selling your crops.

G3=Sowing, fertilizing and reaping are gonna be your A, B and C. \
  Now I\u2019ve heard you can use those computing doohickeys to buy equipment, so be sure to keep that in mind. \
  But listen to me rambling on! I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve got your hands full, but don\u2019t you never forget to call your dear old grandma!
